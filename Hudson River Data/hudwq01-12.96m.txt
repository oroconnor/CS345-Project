2.   Entry Verification:

     Data are analyzed for outliers and anomalies using the outlier macro for 
Excel 5.0 developed by the CDMO.  These macros discover outlier values which 
fall outside the range that the instrument is designed to measure (see section 
II.8 of this document). After outliers and anomalous data are identified, all 
data are graphed in Excel to help identify outliers that fall within the range 
of the probes and also anomalous trends. Missing data are identified using the 
CDMO Excel Date, Hour Count macro.  All columns are formatted using the CDMO 
Excel
Column Reformat macro.  All data was FTPed to the CDMO via the CDMO dial-up 
access.  All raw data files are archived at the CDMO and on 3.5" disks. 
Questionable data are either deleted or identified in section II.10.  All 
missing data and deleted data will be identified in section II.11.

Person responsible for data verification:    Research Coordinator.

3.   Research Objectives:

     Measurements are taken every 30 minutes over a two to four week period from 
April 1 through the end of November of each year at two locations within the 
Tivoli Bays component of the Hudson River NERR.  One datalogger monitors 
tributary water (Saw Kill, SK) entering the bay and the other monitors the 
Hudson River water flooding and ebbing to and from the bay (TS).  The objective 
of this study is to monitor the quality of the surface water  entering (via 
stream flow and tidal exchange) and leaving (via tidal exchange) Tivoli South 
Bay.  This will help us understand the relative importance on each source of 
water on Tivoli South Bay.  The Reserve staff have identified urban and 
residential land use practices as having a major influence on the water 
chemistry of the Saw Kill.  Since residential coverage continues to increase, we 
hope that the intensive monitoring of the surface waters in this watershed will 
identify trends caused by this rapid development.  

4.   Research Methods:  

     Two YSI6000 dataloggers have been placed at the Tivoli Bays component site 
of the Reserve.  The instruments are deployed 0.5 meters off the bottom in 
vertically mounted perforated PVC tubes.  Instruments are deployed for a two to 
four week duration from April through November each year.  Data are collected at 
30 min. intervals.  After instruments are retrieved, instrument calibration is 
checked against standards, data are uploaded, and instrument probes are 
serviced. Before each YSI 6000 is deployed, calibration  and maintenance is 
performed following the manufacturer's instructions (YSI Manual addendum 7/94, 
sections 3,4, and 7). Data are uploaded via a cable to a laptop computer. 
Calibration standards are required for pH, turbidity, and salinity; all other 
parameters are done as described in the manual. Buffer solutions for 2 point 
calibration (pH 7 and 10), salinity and turbidity standards are purchased 
premade from a scientific supply house. The dissolved oxygen membranes are 
replaced before deployment and are allowed to sit at least 24 hrs prior to 
deployment. 

5.   Site Location and Character:

     The Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve (HUDNERR) is a 
multicomponent site composed of approximately 5,000 acres of tidal wetland, open 
water, and adjacent upland buffer habitat.  The four component sites of the 
Reserve are located on the Hudson River in New York State by river miles (RM) 
proceeding north from the southern tip of Manhattan.  These include: Stockport 
Flats (RM 124)(42o02'30"N 73o46'00"W), Columbia County; Tivoli Bays (RM 
98)(42o02'15"N 73o55'10"W), Dutchess County; and Iona Island (RM 45)(41o18'15"N 
73o58'45"W) and Piermont Marsh (RM 24)(41o02'30"N 73o54'15"W), Rockland County.  
These four components are located along 100 river miles of the Hudson and are 
representative of the diverse plant and animal communities that occupy the 
salinity gradient within the Hudson estuary.  Development within the watersheds 
of Hudson River NERR component sites ranges from predominantly urban/suburban to 
forested/agricultural. 
     The two YSI6000 dataloggers are placed at Tivoli Bays component site. The 
Saw Kill (SK) 42? 01’ 01.543”N, 73? 54’ 53.589”W drains a 26.6 square mile 
(6886.5 hectares) watershed that is characterized as a highly mixed land use 
watershed.  These are both freshwater sites (0.0 ppt salinity).  Water depth at 
ranges from 0.0 to 2.0m at TS and 1.0 to 2.0 at SK.  Bottom type at TS is rocky 
and at SK  is soft silt/clay.  The dominant land uses within this watershed 
include: forested (51.1%), agriculture (25.8%), and urban (16.5%).  Tivoli South 
Bay (TS) 42? 01’ 37.336”W, 73? 55’ 33.445”W, the receiving body for the Saw 
Kill, is a tidal freshwater wetland with a tidal range of 3.9 ft. (1.19 m).  
Tivoli North Bay (TN) 42? 02’ 11.56464”N, 73? 55’ 31.16645”W.  

6.   Data collection period:

     YSI6000 datalogger sampling at the Saw Kill (SK) and Tivoli South Bay (TS) 
began during May, 1995.  Sampling at Tivoli North Bay (TN) began during July, 
1996.  All sampling is ongoing, however, we cannot sample from approximately 
December 1 through March 31 due to winter storms and ice on the Hudson River and 
tributaries.  During a tropical storm during mid-July the SK deployment site was 
damaged and we were unable to repair it during 1996.  This site should be 
operational by April 1997.

7.   Associated researchers and projects:

     Hudson River NERR Water Quality Monitoring: Physical and chemical 
constituents of the tributary waters discharging into HUDNERR marshes and marsh 
waters during ebb tides are measured monthly and during storm events.  
Concentrations of nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, dissolved oxygen (DO), and 
chloride are measured, as well as, seston, alkalinity, pH, temperature,salinity, 
and conductivity. 
     Saw Kill Water Quality Monitoring:  The surface water draining from five 
subcatchments representing five dominant land use practices within the Saw Kill 
have been monitored during several storm events.  These five land use practices 
include: row crop agriculture, orchard, residential, solid waste landfill, and 
forested.  All of the above constituents have been monitored during this 
project.
     Associated researchers with the work at Tivoli Bays include: scientists 
from the Institute of Ecosystem Studies, Millbrook, NY; Yale School of Forestry 
and Environmental Studies, New Haven, CT; and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 
Troy, NY.

10.  Data anomalies

April
 
SK:   No turbidity data for entire month, all data that was
     collected was out of range and was deleted.  All values were
     slightly negative.  Cause was probe failure.

TS   Turbidity data for 04/26/96 @ 14:00:00 and 04/30/96 @
     17:30:00 out of range and deleted.

May

SK   No turbidity data for entire month, all data that was
     collected was out of range and was deleted.  Cause was instrument failure.

TS   Turbidity data for 05/01/96 16:30:00 was slightly negative and
     deleted.  Cause was likely mechanical and not a real turbidity event.


June

SK  The following turbidity data deleted because data were out
     of measurable range of instrument: 06/04/96 @ 22:30:00 and
     23:30:00; 06/05/96 @ 01:30:00 and 18:00:00 (values ranged
     from -713.5 to -717.4 NTU.  YSI believes these data were
     caused by an object passing by the turbidity probe during
     the measurement.

TS: The following turbidity data deleted because data were out
     of measurable range of instrument: 06/11/96 @ 19:30:00 and
     06/13/96 @ 13:00:00 (values were -155.7 and -109.0 NTU
     respectively). YSI believes these data were caused by an
     object passing by the turbidity probe during the
     measurement.
 
Negative turbidity spike occurred on 06/25/96 at 00:30 (-0440 NTU).  This data 
point was
likely caused by a probe blockage and was removed.

July

TN   SpCond data for the following dates and times were 00.00
     mS/cm and all data associated with these dates and times has

     17:00:00; 08/26/96 19:00:00.  Data left in, probes were not
     exposed.

     Large negative turbidity spikes occurred on 08/03 14:00 and 08/09 14:00 
(both -737 
NTU). 
     These were likely caused by probe blockage and have been deleted.

     No data collected at TS, TN, or SK, no instruments deployed
until April due to ice and late winter storms.

April

SK   No data collected from 04/01/96 @ 00:00:00 through 04/25/96
     @ 13:00:00, instruments not deployed until 04/25/96 at
     13:30:00 due to ice and late winter storms.

     No turbidity data for entire month, all data that was
     collected was out of range and was deleted.  All values were
     slightly negative.  Cause was likely probe failure.

TS   No data collected from 04/01/96 @ 00:00:00 through 04/17/96
     @ 07:30:00, instuments not deployed until 04/17/96 @
     08:00:00 due to ice and winter storms.

     Turbidity data for 04/26/96 @ 14:00:00 and 04/30/96 @
     17:30:00 out of range and deleted.  Likely cause was probe blockage.

TN   No data, instrument not deployed

May

SK   No turbidity data for entire month, all data that was
     collected was out of range and was deleted.  Likely cause was probe 
failure.

June

SK   No data from 06/01/96 @ 00:00:00 through 06/04/96 @ 08:30:00
     and 06/20/96 @ 03:30:00 through 06/26/96 @ 13:00:00. 
     Instrument out for servicing.

     The following turbidity data deleted because data were out
     of measurable range of instrument: 06/04/96 @ 22:30:00 and
     23:30:00; 06/05/96 @ 01:30:00 and 18:00:00 (values ranged
     from -713.5 to -717.4 NTU.  YSI believes these data were
     caused by an object passing by the turbidity probe during
     the measurement.

TS   No data from 06/01/96 @ 00:00:00 through 06/04/96 @ 08:30:00
     and 06/25/96 @ 10:30:00 through 06/26/96 @ 13:00:00. 
     Instrument out for servicing.

     The following turbidity data deleted because data were out
     of measurable range of instrument: 06/11/96 @ 19:30:00 and
     06/13/96 @ 13:00:00 (values were -155.7 and -109.0 NTU
     respectively). YSI believes these data were caused by an
     object passing by the turbidity probe during the
     measurement.

Negative turbidity spike occurred on 06/25/96 at 00:30 (-0440 NTU).  This data 
point was
likely caused by a probe blockage and was removed.
