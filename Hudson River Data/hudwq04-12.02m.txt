2.   Entry Verification:

	The CDMO cdmomac3.xls macro will allow the user to automatically format 
column widths to the correct number of decimal places based on YSI sensor 
specifications.  It also allows the user to QA/QC each datalogger generated file 
for missing data points, fill all cells that do not contain data with periods, 
and find all data points that fall outside the range of what the data logger is 
designed to measure (outliers).  The CDMO import.xls macro will allow PC users 
with 30-minute data to automatically create a monthly Excel file from a two-week 
deployment and insert periods for missing data.  In addition, in November 1999 a 
graphing capability was added to this macro allowing users to produce single 
parameter and missing data point graphs on a monthly basis.  Questionable data 
are either deleted or identified in section II.10.
	
	Persons responsible for data verification are the Research Coordinator and 
Research Assistant.

3.   Research Objectives:

	Measurements are taken every 30 minutes over a two to four week period 
from the beginning of April through the end of December of each year at four 
locations within the Tivoli Bays component of the Hudson River NERR.  Two 
separate dataloggers monitor the Hudson River water flooding and ebbing within 
each bay (Tivoli South Bay and Tivoli North Bay).  One datalogger monitors the 
tributary water (Saw Kill Creek) entering the Tivoli South Bay, and the 
tributary water (Stony Creek) entering the Tivoli North Bay is monitored by 
another datalogger.  The objective of this study is to monitor the quality of 
the surface water entering (via stream flow and tidal exchange) and leaving (via 
tidal exchange) Tivoli South Bay and Tivoli North Bay.  This will help us 
understand the relative importance on each source of water in Tivoli Bays.  The 
Reserve staff has identified urban and residential land use practices as having 
a major influence on the water chemistry of the Saw Kill Creek.  Since 
residential coverage continues to increase, we hope that the intensive 
monitoring of the surface waters in this watershed will identify trends caused 
by this rapid development.

4.   Research Methods:  

	Four YSI 6-series datalogger instruments have been placed at the Tivoli 
Bays component site of the Reserve.  The Saw Kill Creek and Tivoli South Bay 
instruments are deployed at 0.5 and 0.5 meters respectively off the bottom in 
vertically mounted perforated PVC tubes. These instruments also use a depth 
sensor that is vented to the atmosphere for more precise depth readings.  Non-
vented instruments are deployed at Stony Creek and Tivoli North Bay in 
rectangular 24"x13"x13" cages that are plastic coated, 1/2 inch mesh. The cages 
are weighted down with 4 bricks zip tied to the cage.  For deployments, the 
instrument is strapped horizontally to the inside top of the cage with bungee 
cords and rests .25 meters from the bottom of the cage.  At Stony Creek, the 
cage is placed at the edge of the creek, resting on the bottom, beneath a 
bridge. The cage is tethered with a cable and locked to an I-bolt attached to 
the bridge.  At Tivoli North Bay, the cage is tied to a woodpile and rests on 
the bottom. In addition, a cable is attached to the top of the cage and the 
other end is anchored to the sediment.  Instruments are deployed for two to four 
week durations from April through December of each year.  Data are collected at 
30 minute intervals. After instruments are retrieved, instrument calibration is 
checked against standards, and the instrument probes are serviced.  The data are 
uploaded via a cable to a desktop computer.  Before each YSI 6-series datalogger 
is deployed, calibration and maintenance is performed following the 
manufacturer's instructions (YSI Manual, sections 3,4, and 7 as well as the YSI 
6-series operations manual).  The dissolved oxygen membranes are replaced before 
deployment, and are allowed to equilibrate for at least 24 hrs prior to 
deployment.  Calibration standards are required for pH, turbidity, and 
conductivity; all other parameters are calibrated as described in the manual.  
Standard solutions of pH buffers, conductivity and turbidity are purchased pre-
made from a scientific supply company.

5.   Site Location and Character:

	The Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve (HUDNERR) is a 
multicomponent site composed of approximately 5,000 acres of tidal wetland, open 
water, and adjacent upland buffer habitat.  The four component sites of the 
Reserve are located on the Hudson River in New York State by river miles (RM) 
proceeding north from the southern tip of Manhattan.  These include: Stockport 
Flats (RM 124)(42° 02'30"N 73° 46'00"W), Columbia County; Tivoli Bays (RM 
98)(42° 02'15"N 73(55'10"W), Dutchess County; and Iona Island (RM 45)(41° 
18'15"N 73(58'45"W) and Piermont Marsh (RM 24)(41° 02'30"N 73° 54'15"W), 
Rockland County.  These four components are located along 100 miles of the 
Hudson River and are representative of the diverse plant and animal communities 
that occupy the salinity gradient within the Hudson estuary.  Development within 
the watersheds of Hudson River NERR component sites ranges from predominantly 
urban/suburban to forested/agricultural.  The four YSI 6-series dataloggers are 
placed at the Tivoli Bays component site.  The Saw Kill Creek (latitude 42° 01' 
01.543" N, longitude 73° 54' 53.589" W) drains a 26.6 square mile area, and it 
is the main tributary flowing into Tivoli South Bay.  Some characteristics of 
the Saw kill include a rocky bottom type, and a watershed that is characterized 
as a highly mixed land use watershed.  Water depth in this creek varies from 0.5 
to 2.0 meters.  Tivoli South Bay (latitude 42° 01' 37.336" N, longitude 73° 55' 
33.445" W) is the receiving body for the Saw Kill Creek.  This bay is a tidal 
freshwater wetland with a tidal range of 1.19 meters, while the bottom type is a 
soft, silt/clay.  Dominant land uses within its watershed include: forested 
(51.1%), agriculture (25.8%), and urban (16.5%) areas.  Tivoli North Bay 
(latitude 42° 02' 11.56464" N, longitude 73° 55' 31.16645" W) is a freshwater 
tidal marsh dominated by Typha angustifolia.  Tivoli North Bay has a tidal range 
of 1.19 meters, and a soft/silt bottom as well.  The primary watershed to this 
bay is about 23 square miles in size, and it is dominated by agricultural lands. 
Water depth ranges from 0.0 to 2.0 m at both Tivoli South Bay and Tivoli North 
Bay. Stony Creek (latitude 42° 02' 45.556"  N, longitude 73° 54' 40.237" W) is 
the main tributary for the Tivoli North Bay. The creek bottom type is mostly 
solid rock, and the depth varies from 0.5 to 1.5 meters.  These sites of the 
Tivoli Bays component are all freshwater sites (0.0 ppt salinity).

6.   Data collection period:

	YSI 6-series datalogger sampling at the Saw Kill (SK) and Tivoli South Bay 
(TS) began during May, 1995.  Sampling at Tivoli North Bay (TN) began during 
July, 1996, however ceased in 1997-1998 because at low tide the instrument was 
exposed.  In 1999, an alternate site was established for Tivoli North, and 
sampling began in July of 1999.  Sampling began at Stony Creek (SC) in April of 
2002.  All sampling is ongoing, however, we cannot sample from approximately mid 
December through the end of March due to winter storms and ice on the Hudson 
River and the tributaries.  The YSI6600 datalogger was deployed at the Tivoli 
South Bay site replacing the YSI6000 starting on July 1, 1999 @ 15:30:00.

7.	Distribution
	NOAA Ocean and Coastal Resource Management Data Ownership and 
Dissemination Policy for the NERRS National Monitoring Program: 
	Data collected in conjunction  with the National Estuarine Research 
Reserve System's (NERRS) National Monitoring Program is considered public 
information. The principle investigators (PIs) responsible for collecting data 
at each NERRS site must process the data  using Estuarine Reserve Division (ERD) 
approved quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols. The PI has 
three (3) months from the date of data collection to process the data, and then 
three (3) months from the date of data  processing to transmit the QA/QC 
processed data to ERD or an ERD approved Centralized Data Management Office 
(CDMO) in accordance with the standard rules for application to oceanographic 
data sets (NOAA Administrative Order  216-101). The schedule reflected below 
assumes an adequate and uninterrupted funding for the monitoring effort at each 
site, therefore the data processing and the transmission timetable may be 
adjusted accordingly. 
	Unpublished intellectual property owned and developed by the recipient 
with federal assistance funds, i.e., processed data, will not be officially 
disseminated to the public for a period of one (1) year from the date of  data 
processing. After one (1) year the QA/QC processed data will be made officially 
available to the general public on the Internet by the CDMO. However, if the 
data are requested pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the  Government 
is required to release any data which are transferred to the Government by the 
recipient under the award. 
	An awardee may own a copyright on the publication of the processed data 
developed or bought under a Federal assistance award. The Federal awarding 
agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable license to 
reproduce, publish, or otherwise use, and to authorize others to use, for 
Federal government purposes, the copyright in any work developed under an award, 
or any rights of copyright purchased by an awardee with Federal assistance 
support (15 C.F.R. 24.34). Any such publication will include a notice 
identifying the award and recognizing the license rights of the government under 
this clause. This paragraph will have no force and effect for the processed data 
not published by the recipient. 

	NOAA/ERD retains the right to analyze, synthesize and publish summaries of 
the NERRS System-wide Monitoring Program data. The PI retains the right to be 
fully credited for having collected and processed the data. Following academic 
courtesy standards, the PI and NERR site where the data were collected will be 
contacted and fully acknowledged in any subsequent publications in which any 
part of the data is used. Manuscripts resulting from this NOAA/OCRM-supported 
research that are produced for publication in open literature, including 
refereed scientific journals, will acknowledge that the research was conducted 
under an award from the Estuarine Reserves Division, Office of Ocean and Coastal 
Resource Management, National Ocean Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration. .  The data set enclosed within this package/transmission 
is only as good as the quality assurance and quality control procedures 
outlined by the enclosed metadata reporting statement.  The user bears 
all responsibility for its subsequent use/misuse in any further analyses 
or comparisons.  The Federal government does not assume liability to the 
Recipient or third persons, nor will the Federal government reimburse or 
indemnify the Recipient for its liability due to any losses resulting in 
any way from the use of this data. 

NERR water quality data and metadata can be obtained from the Research 
Coordinator at the individual NERR site (please see Section 2.2-1 Principal 
investigators and contact persons), from the Data Manager at the Centralized 
Data Management Office (please see personnel directory under the general 
information link on the CDMO home page) and online at the CDMO home page

Microsoft Excel spreadsheet format and comma-delimited format.   


8.   Associated researchers and projects:

	Hudson River NERR Water Quality Monitoring: Physical and chemical 
constituents of the tributary waters discharging into HUDNERR marshes and marsh 
waters during ebb tides are measured monthly and during storm events. 
Concentrations of nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, dissolved oxygen (DO), and 
chloride are measured, as well as, seston, alkalinity, pH, temperature, 
salinity, and conductivity.	Saw Kill Water Quality Monitoring:  The surface 
water draining from five subcatchments representing five dominant land use 
practices within the Saw Kill have been monitored during several storm events. 
These five land use practices include: row crop agriculture, orchard, 
residential, solid waste landfill, and forested. All of the above constituents 
have been monitored during this project.
	
	Associated researchers with the work at Tivoli Bays include:  scientists

Negative depth readings were recorded during the following times, however the 
probes were not exposed to air. These negative measurements were likely due to 
changes in atmospheric pressure, since the depth sensor is not vented. The 
following data were left in:

The readings indicate the probes were exposed to the air and the instrument may 
have been above water. All the following data were removed:
09/01/02	00:00:00 - 09/11/02	14:00:00
09/28/02	03:00:00 - 09/30/02	23:30:00

High turbidity reading occurred and it is probably due to a blocked probe.  The 
following turbidity data was deleted:
Date		Time		Turb
09/28/2002	01:30:00	1411

Turbidity readings were very low including values of zero and negative numbers, 
but the negative numbers were within the detection limit of the probe. The 
following data were left in:

12.  Missing Data 

	Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set. Data are missing due 
to equipment failure where no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre and post) problems. For more details on deleted data, see 
the Anomalous Data (Section 10). To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14. Other Remarks

On 06/30/2021 this dataset was updated to include embedded QAQC flags for 
anomalous/suspect data.  System-wide monitoring data beginning in 2007 were 
processed to allow for QAQC flags and codes to be embedded in the data files 
rather than detailed in the metadata alone (as in the anomalous/suspect, 
deleted, and missing data sections above).  Prior to 2006, rejected data 
were deleted from the dataset so they are unavailable to be used at all, 
but suspect data were only noted in the metadata document.  Suspect data 
flags <1> were embedded retroactively in order to allow suspect data to be 
easily identified and filtered from the dataset if desired for analysis and 
reporting purposes.  No other flags or codes were embedded in the dataset 
and users should still refer to the detailed explanations above for more 
information.

	Any reference made to depth data being negative and/or zero, it was 
recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in the edited data file 
due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited none of these data points 
by hand nor did the technician delete any of them.
