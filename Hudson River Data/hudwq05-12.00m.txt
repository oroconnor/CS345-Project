2.   Entry Verification:

	Data are analyzed for outliers and anomalies using the outlier macro for 
Excel 2000 developed by the CDMO.  These macros discover outlier values which 
fall outside the range that the instrument is designed to measure (see section 
II.8 of this document). After outliers and anomalous data are identified, all 
data are graphed in Excel using the CDMO graphing macro to help identify 
anomalous data that fall within the range of the probes and also anomalous 
trends. Missing data are identified using the CDMO Excel Date, Hour Count macro.  
All columns are formatted using the CDMO Excel Column Reformat macro.  All data 
was FTPed to the CDMO via the CDMO dial-up access.  All raw data files are 
archived at the CDMO and at the reserve on on 3.5" disks, ditto tapes, and CD-
ROM. Questionable data are either deleted or identified in section II.10.

Person responsible for data verification:
Research Coordinator and Research Assistant, Erik Bedan.

3.   Research Objectives:

	Measurements are taken every 30 minutes over a two to four week period 
from May 1 through the end of December of each year at three locations within 
the Tivoli Bays component of the Hudson River NERR.  One datalogger monitors 
tributary water (Saw Kill, SK) entering one bay and two dataloggers monitor the 
Hudson River water flooding and ebbing to and from both bays (Tivoli South Bay, 
TS and Tivoli North Bay, TN).  The objective of this study is to monitor the 
quality of the surface water entering (via stream flow and tidal exchange) and 
leaving (via tidal exchange) Tivoli South Bay and Tivoli North Bay.  This will 
help us understand the relative importance on each source of water in Tivoli 
Bays.  The Reserve staff have identified urban and residential land use 
practices as having a major influence on the water chemistry of the Saw Kill.  
Since residential coverage continues to increase, we hope that the intensive 
monitoring of the surface waters in this watershed will identify trends caused 
by this rapid development.

4.   Research Methods:  

	Three YSI 6-series dataloggers have been placed at the Tivoli Bays 
component site of the Reserve.  The SK and TS instruments are deployed at 0.5 
and 0.6 meters respectively off the bottom in vertically mounted perforated PVC 
tubes.  The TN instrument is deployed in a rectangular 24"x13"x13" cage with 1/2 
inch plastic coated mesh and weighed down with 4 bricks zip tied to the cage.  
The sonde is placed horizontally in the cage, strapped in with bungee cords and 
rests .25 meters from the bottom of the cage.  The cage is tied to a wood pile 
and rests on the bottom, also a cable is attached to the top of the cage and the 
other end is anchored to the sediment.  Instruments are deployed for a two to 
four week duration from April through December of each year.  Data are collected 
at 30 min. intervals. After instruments are retrieved, instrument calibration is 
checked against standards, data are uploaded, and instrument probes are 
serviced.  Before each YSI 6-series datalogger is deployed, calibration and 
maintenance is performed following the manufacturer's instructions (YSI Manual, 
sections 3,4, and 7 as well as the YSI 6-series operations manual). Data are 
uploaded via a cable to a laptop computer. Calibration standards are required 
for pH, turbidity, and conductivity; all other parameters are calibrated as 
described in the manual.  pH buffer solutions for 2 point calibration (pH 7 and 
10), conductivity and turbidity standards are purchased pre-made from a 
scientific supply house. The dissolved oxygen membranes are replaced before 
deployment, and are allowed to equilibrate for at least 24 hrs prior to 
deployment. 

5.   Site Location and Character:

	The Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve (HUDNERR) is a 
multicomponent site composed of approximately 5,000 acres of tidal wetland, open 
water, and adjacent upland buffer habitat.  The four component sites of the 
Reserve are located on the Hudson River in New York State by river miles (RM) 
proceeding north from the southern tip of Manhattan.  These include: Stockport 
Flats (RM 124)(42o02'30"N 73o46'00"W), Columbia County; Tivoli Bays (RM 
98)(42o02'15"N 73o55'10"W), Dutchess County; and Iona Island (RM 45)(41o18'15"N 
73o58'45"W) and Piermont Marsh (RM 24)(41o02'30"N 73o54'15"W), Rockland County.  
These four components are located along 100 river miles of the Hudson and are 
representative of the diverse plant and animal communities that occupy the 
salinity gradient within the Hudson River estuary.  Development within the 
watersheds of Hudson River NERR component sites ranges from predominantly 
urban/suburban to forested/agricultural.
	The three YSI 6-series dataloggers are placed at the Tivoli Bays component 
site.  These are freshwater sites (0.0 ppt salinity).  The Saw Kill Creek (SK) 
(latitude 42 01' 01.543" N, longitude 73 54' 53.589" W) drains a 26.6 square 
mile (6886.5 hectares) watershed that is characterized as a highly mixed land 
use watershed.  Water depth ranges from 1.0 to 1.5m at SK, and the bottom type 
is soft silt/clay.  Tivoli South Bay (TS) (latitude 42 01' 37.336" N, longitude 
73 55' 33.445" W), the receiving body for the Saw Kill Creek, is a tidal 
freshwater wetland with a tidal range of 1.19m (3.9 ft.).   Bottom type at TS is 
rocky, while the water depth ranges from 0.0 to 2.0m.  The dominant land uses 
within this watershed include: forested (51.1%), agriculture (25.8%), and urban 
(16.5%) areas.  Tivoli North Bay (TN) (latitude 42 02' 11.56464" N, longitude 73 
55' 31.16645" W) is a freshwater tidal marsh dominated by Typha angustifolia.  
Water depth ranges from 1.0 to 2.5m, and the bottom type is rock/silt at TN.  
The primary watershed to TN is 23 square miles in size and is dominated by 
agricultural lands.  The Stony Creek is the principle tributary to Tivoli North 
Bay.


6.   Data collection period:

	YSI 6-series datalogger sampling at the Saw Kill (SK) and Tivoli South Bay 
(TS) began during May, 1995.  Sampling at Tivoli North Bay (TN) began during 
July,1996, however ceased in 1997-1998 because at low tide the instrument was 
exposed.  In 1999 an alternate site was established and sampling began in July 
of 1999 .  All sampling is ongoing, however, we cannot sample from approximately 
mid December through April 31 due to winter storms and ice on the Hudson River 
and the tributaries.  The YSI6600 datalogger was deployed at the Tivoli South 
Bay site replacing the YSI6000 starting on July 1, 1999 @ 15:30:00.

7.   Associated researchers and projects:

	Hudson River NERR Water Quality Monitoring: Physical and chemical 
constituents of the tributary waters discharging into HUDNERR marshes and marsh 
waters during ebb tides are measured monthly and during storm events.  
Concentrations of nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, dissolved oxygen (DO), and 
chloride are measured, as well as, seston, alkalinity, pH, temperature, 
salinity, and conductivity.
	Saw Kill Water Quality Monitoring:  The surface water draining from five 
subcatchments representing five dominant land use practices within the Saw Kill 
have been monitored during several storm events.  These five land use practices 
include: row crop agriculture, orchard, residential, solid waste landfill, and 
forested.  All of the above constituents have been monitored during this 
project.

May

TN:

Negative turbidity readings occurred and they are probably due to a blocked 
probe.  The following turbidity data were removed:

Date		Time		Turb

Sonde batteries failed during deployment on 05/31/00 13:30-23:30. No data during 
this time. 


TS:

Negative depth readings were recorded on 05/31/00 between 18:00 and 18:30. The 
cause was either an atmospheric pressure change or the pressure transducer was 
out of the water, but the data were left in because no other parameters 
correlated as outliers.

11.  Missing Data 

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set. Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre and post) problems. For more details on deleted data, see 
the Anomalous Data (Section 10). To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

12. Other Remarks

On 06/30/2021 this dataset was updated to include embedded QAQC flags for 
anomalous/suspect data.  System-wide monitoring data beginning in 2007 were 
processed to allow for QAQC flags and codes to be embedded in the data files 
rather than detailed in the metadata alone (as in the anomalous/suspect, 
deleted, and missing data sections above).  Prior to 2006, rejected data 
were deleted from the dataset so they are unavailable to be used at all, 
but suspect data were only noted in the metadata document.  Suspect data 
flags <1> were embedded retroactively in order to allow suspect data to be 
easily identified and filtered from the dataset if desired for analysis and 
reporting purposes.  No other flags or codes were embedded in the dataset and 
users should still refer to the detailed explanations above for more 
information.

Any time a reference is made to depth data being negative and/or zero, it was 
recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in the edited data file 
due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited none of these data points 
by hand nor did he/she delete any of them.
