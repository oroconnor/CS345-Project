2.   Entry Verification:

Data are uploaded in .dat and comma delimited format via a cable to a laptop 
computer. Data are analyzed for outliers and anomalies using the outlier macro 
for Excel 5.0 developed by the CDMO.  These macros discover outlier values which 
fall outside the range that the instrument is designed to measure (see section 
II.8 of this document). After outliers and anomalous data are identified, all 
data are graphed in Excel to help identify outliers that fall within the range 
of the probes and also anomalous trends. Missing data are identified using the 
CDMO Excel Date, Hour Count macro.  All columns are formatted using the CDMO 
Excel Column Reformat macro.  All data was FTPed to the CDMO via the CDMO dial-up 
access.  All raw data files are archived at the CDMO and on 3.5" disks. 
Questionable data are either deleted or identified in section II.10.  All 
missing data and deleted data will be identified in section II.11.

Person responsible for data verification:    Research Coordinator.

3.   Research Objectives:

     Measurements are taken every 30 minutes over a two to four week period from 
April 1 through the end of November of each year at two locations within the 
Tivoli Bays component of the Hudson River NERR.  One datalogger monitors 
tributary water (Saw Kill, SK) entering the bay and the other monitors the 
Hudson River water flooding and ebbing to and from the bay (TS).  The objective 
of this study is to monitor the quality of the surface water entering (via 
stream flow and tidal exchange) and leaving (via tidal exchange) Tivoli South 
Bay.  This will help us understand the relative importance on each source of 
water on Tivoli South Bay.  The Reserve staff have identified urban and 
residential land use practices as having a major influence on the water 
chemistry of the Saw Kill.  Since residential coverage continues to increase, we 
hope that the intensive monitoring of the surface waters in this watershed will 
identify trends caused by this rapid development.  

4.   Research Methods:  

     Two YSI6000 dataloggers have been placed at the Tivoli Bays  component site 
of the Reserve.  The instruments are deployed 0.5 meters off the bottom in 
vertically mounted perforated PVC tubes.  Instruments are deployed for a two to 
four week duration from April through November each year.  Data are collected at 
30 min. intervals. After instruments are retrieved, instrument calibration is 
checked against standards, data are uploaded, and instrument probes are 
serviced. Before each YSI 6000 is deployed, calibration and maintenance is 
performed following the manufacturer's instructions (YSI Manual addendum 7/94, 
sections 3,4, and 7). Calibration standards are required for pH, turbidity, and 
salinity; all other parameters are done as described in the manual. Buffer 
solutions for 2 point calibration (pH 7 and 10), salinity and turbidity 
standards are purchased premade from a scientific supply house. The dissolved 
oxygen membranes are replaced before deployment and are allowed to sit at least 
24 hrs prior to deployment. 

5.   Site Location and Character:

     The Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve (HUDNERR) is a 
multicomponent site composed of approximately 5,000 acres of tidal wetland, open 
water, and adjacent upland buffer habitat.  The four component sites of the 
Reserve are located on the Hudson River in New York State by river miles (RM) 
proceeding north from the southern tip of Manhattan.  These include: Stockport 
Flats (RM 124)(42o02'30"N 73o46'00"W), Columbia County; Tivoli Bays (RM 
98)(42o02'15"N 73o55'10"W), Dutchess County; and Iona Island (RM 45)(41o18'15"N 
73o58'45"W) and Piermont Marsh (RM 24)(41o02'30"N 73o54'15"W), Rockland County.  
These four components are located along 100 river miles of the Hudson and are 
representative of the diverse plant and animal communities that occupy the 
salinity gradient within the Hudson estuary.  Development within the watersheds 
of Hudson River NERR component sites ranges from predominantly urban/suburban to 
forested/agricultural. 
     The two YSI6000 dataloggers are placed at Tivoli Bays component site. The 
Saw Kill (SK) 42? 01’ 01.543”N, 73? 54’ 53.589”W drains a 26.6 square mile 
(6886.5 hectares) watershed that is characterized as a highly mixed land use 
watershed.  These are both freshwater sites (0.0 ppt salinity).  Water depth at 
ranges from 0.0 to 2.0m at TS and 1.0 to 2.0 at SK.  Bottom type at TS is rocky 
and at SK  is soft silt/clay.  The dominant land uses within this watershed 
include: forested (51.1%), agriculture (25.8%), and urban (16.5%).  Tivoli South 
Bay (TS) 42? 01’ 37.336”W, 73? 55’ 33.445”W, the receiving body for the Saw 
Kill, is a tidal freshwater wetland with a tidal range of 3.9 ft. (1.19 m).

6.   Data collection period:

     YSI6000 datalogger sampling at the Saw Kill (SK) and Tivoli South Bay (TS) 
began during May, 1995.  Sampling at Tivoli North Bay (TN) began during July, 
1996.  All sampling is ongoing, however, we cannot sample from approximately 
December 1 through March 31 due to winter storms and ice on the Hudson River and 
tributaries.  During a tropical storm during mid-July the SK deployment site was 
damaged and we were unable to repair it during 1996.  This site should be 
operational by April 1997. 

7.   Associated researchers and projects:

     Hudson River NERR Water Quality Monitoring: Physical and chemical 
constituents of the tributary waters discharging into HUDNERR marshes and marsh 
waters during ebb tides are measured monthly and during storm events.  
Concentrations of nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, dissolved oxygen (DO), and 
chloride are measured, as well as, seston, alkalinity, pH, temperature, 
salinity, and conductivity. 
     Saw Kill Water Quality Monitoring:  The surface water draining from five 
subcatchments representing five dominant land use practices within the Saw Kill 
have been monitored during several storm events.  These five land use practices 
include: row crop agriculture, orchard, residential, solid waste landfill, and 
forested.  All of the above constituents have been monitored during this 
project.
     Associated researchers with the work at Tivoli Bays include: scientists 
from the Institute of Ecosystem Studies, Millbrook, NY; Yale School of Forestry 
and Environmental Studies, New Haven, CT; and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 
Troy, NY.

10.  Data anomalies

April

TS: No anomalies to report, instrument not yet deployed (see next section for 
explanation).

SK: Dissolved oxygen and percent saturation data were too high.  Post deployment 
calibration check indicated the dissolved oxygen sensor was bad or needed cleaning (high 
charge error indicated during next calibration attempt).  All oxygen data collected from 
04/23/97 at 10:30:00 through end of month have been removed.

May

TS: Many negative turbidity data were collected (range: -0001 to -0762 NTU). 
Negative values from -0000.2 to -0002 are within the sensitivity of the instrument and are most 
likely 0000 NTU. Small negative values less than -0002 NTU (-0003 to -0008) are likely due to 
calibration errors. The cause of the larger negative values (<-0005) is not known but many of them 
do occur on an out going tide and may be caused by a plume of resuspended sediments.  The 
following negative turbidity data were collected but left in the data set (note that any values 
represented as 0000 NTU have been rounded up from -0000.2 NTU by the CDMO Excel macros):

Dissolved oxygen or oxygen saturation from 05/09/97 11:30:00 through end of 
month deleted. All were too high (over 140% saturation) due to faulty probe.  

SK: Dissolved oxygen and percent saturation values were too high from 05/01/97 
00:00:00 through 05/08/97 14:00:00 and were removed from the dataset.  Post deployment 
check indicated the sensor went bad.

05/19/97 @ 22:00 Negative turbidity was recorder (-267NTU)

June

TS: The following depth data were slightly negative.  These were likely caused 
by a change in atmospheric pressure between calibration/deployment and the time these 
measurements were taken.  Values were left in the data set in order to allow for a clean tidal 
curve:

All dissolved oxygen and percent saturation values from 06/01/97 00:00:00 
through 06/05/97 10:30:00 were too high (all over 100%) due to a faulty probe.  All values were 
deleted.

All dissolved oxygen and percent saturation values from 06/26/97 10:00:00 
through 06/30/97 23:30:00 were questionable due to a faulty probe.  All values were 
deleted.

SK: Nothing to report.

July

TS: Many negative turbidity data were collected (range: -0000.2  to -0782 NTU).  
Negative values greater than -0001 are within the sensitivity of the instrument and are 
most likely 0000 NTU (these values appear as 0000 NTU in the dataset.  Small negative values less 
than -0002 NTU (-0003 to -0008) are likely due to calibration errors.  The cause of the 
larger negative values (<-0008) is not known but most of them do occur on an out going tide and 
may be caused by a plume of resuspended sediments exceeding the maximum range of the 
instrument.  The following negative turbidity data were collected but left in the data set (note 
that values represented as 0000 NTU have been rounded up from -0000.2 NTU by the CDMO Excel

All dissolved oxygen and percent saturation values from 07/01/97 00:00:00 
through 07/16/97 17:00:00 were questionable due to a faulty probe.  All values were 
deleted.

SK: Nothing to report
          
August:

TS: Several turbidity values collected were slightly negative but are within the 
range of sensitivity of the probe (+/- 0002 NTU).  All were left in the data set and are 
likely 0000 NTU.  The following negative turbidity data were collected but left in the data set 
(note that values represented as 0000 NTU have been rounded up from -0000.2 NTU by the CDMO Excel 
macros):

During a deployment starting on 08/06/97 at 09:00:00, the dissolved oxygen and 
percent saturation values began to drift to high values.  Post deployment check of the 
instrument indicated the DO sensor on this probe had gone bad during deployment.  Since we 
could not determine which values were good and which were affected, all values from 
08/06/97 09:00:00 through the end of the month were deleted.
          
SK: The following turbidity values ranged from -0000.3 to -0000.1 NTU.  All were 
replaced with 0000 NTU (the slight negative values are well within the detection range of the 
instrument of +/- 0002 NTU).  Also, all of these values are rounded to the nearest whole number 
(hence all appear as 0000 NTU below) as per CDMO data management protocol.

October:

TS: Two turbidity values were negative. One on 10/06/97 @ 13:00:00 (-0086 NTU) 
was a single anomalous data point and was deleted (YSI attributes cause as an object passing 
in front of the probe).  The other was slightly negative (-0000.1 NTU) and
occurred on 10/12/97 @ 17:00:00.  This point is well within the detection range 
of the instrument (+/- 0002 NTU) and was treated as 0000 NTU in the data set. 

The following depth values were negative, were likely caused by changes in 
atmospheric pressure (the probes were not exposed), and were left in the data set:

Date      Time      Depth
mm/dd/yy  hh:mm:ss   m
10/28/97  05:30:00  -0.06
10/28/97  06:00:00  -0.10
10/28/97  06:30:00  -0.09
10/28/97  07:00:00  -0.02

All values deleted because probes were exposed at low tide due to the zero salinity and 
low depth from 10/28/97 18:30:00 through 19:00:00.

SK: The following negative dissolved oxygen and saturation values were recorded 
(likely caused by probe failure).  The following were removed from the data set:

10/29/97  07:00:00  -00.8     -006.2

The remaining DO and %sat values for the month (10/29/97 7:30:00 thru 10/31/97 
23:30:00) were positive but are suspect because of the failing probes.  These data were 
also removed from the set.

The following turbidity values were slightly negative (-0000.1NTU)(appear as 
0000NTU since these are rounded to nearest whole number by CDMO Excel macros).  Theses values 
were left in dataset and treated as 0000 NTU since they are well within the detection limit 
of +/- 0002NTU of the instrument.

November

TS: The following turbidity values were negative but were left in the data set 
since I could not determine if they were erroneous:

Date                Time      Turb
mm/dd/yy   hh:mm:ss   NTU
11/26/97     13:30:00    -0016
11/26/97     14:00:00    -0024
11/26/97     14:30:00    -0019

All values deleted because probes were exposed at low tide due to the zero salinity and 
low depth from 11/27/97 16:00:00 through 20:30:00.

SK: During the deployment of an instrument (10/28/97 12:00:00 - 11/12/97 
13:00:00) the dissolved oxygen sensor recorded many negative values for percent saturation and 
concentration of oxygen.  The values collected from 11/01/97 00:00:00 through 11/12/97 
13:00:00 were unusually low, are not reliable, and have been removed from the dataset.

December:

TS: The following data are missing (removed) because the probes were exposed at 
low tide: 12/02/97 09:30:00; 12/02/97 21:30:00 - 22:30:00; 12/03/07 09:00:00 - 11:00:00; 
12/14/97 20:30:00 - 21:30:00

All values deleted because probes were exposed at low tide due to the zero salinity and 
low depth from 12/15/97 07:30:00 through 09:30:00.

TS: The following negative depth values were recorded, all were likely caused by 
changed in atmospheric pressure (no evidence that the probes were exposed to air) and were 
left in the data set (note that 0.00 values were slightly negative but were rounded up to 0.00 by 
the CDMO Excel macros):

Date      Time      Depth

12/14/97  07:30:00  -0.02
12/14/97  08:00:00  -0.04

The following negative turbidity values were collected but were unexplainable so 
were left in the dataset:
Date       Time          Turb (NTU)
12/06/97  21:30:00     -0064
12/0697   22:00:00      -0037
12/06/97 22:30:00       -0037
12/15/97 19:30:00       -0021

A negative turbidity spike occurred on 12/14/97 @ 22:00:00 and was removed since 
it was likely caused by the turbidity probe being exposed for the previous hour.

SK: Negative depth occurred on 12/29/97 10:00:00 because instrument was 
retrieved prior to this sample being taken.  All data for this date/time were removed.

Shortly after the 12/14/97 17:00:00 deployment, all DO and DO% values dropped 
rapidly to below 5.0%.  Post deployment calibration check indicated very low DO% (39.3%).  
All DO and DO% data from 12/14/97 17:00:00 to end of deployment (12/29/97 09:30:00) were 
removed. Cause is unknown but likely caused by faulty DO sensor.

11.  Missing Data 

TN: April - December.  Note that no instruments were deployed at this site 
during 1997.  Review of the 1996 data indicated that the deployment site was exposed during daily low 
tides.  A new site has been identified and we hope to deploy instruments at TN in 1998.

April:

TS:  No data collected for entire month.  Delay caused by snow and ice storm on 
04/01/97 that downed trees and prevented access to deployment site.

SK: No data collected from 04/01/97 00:00:00 through 04/23/97 10:00:00.  
Instrument not deployed.  Delay caused by snow and ice storm on 04/01/97 that downed trees and 
prevented access to deployment site.

No salinity data collected from 04/23/97 10:30:00 through end of
month (site is freshwater, so salinity range is 0.0 to 0.2 ppt).

Dissolved oxygen and percent saturation data were too high.  Post deployment 
calibration check indicated the dissolved oxygen sensor was bad.  All oxygen data collected from 
04/23/97 at 10:30:00 through end of month have been removed.

May

TS:  No data collected from 05/01/97 00:00:00 through 05/09/97 11:00:00.  
Instrument not deployed.  Delay caused by snow and ice storm on 04/01/97 that downed trees and 
prevented access to deployment site.

No salinity data collected from 05/09/97 11:30:00 through end of
month (site is freshwater, so salinity range is 0.0 to 0.01 ppt).

Dissolved oxygen or oxygen saturation from 05/09/97 11:30:00 through end of 
month deleted. All were too high (over 140% saturation) due to faulty probe.

SK: Dissolved oxygen and percent saturation values were too high from 05/01/97 
00:00:00 through 05/08/97 14:00:00 and were removed from the dataset.  Post deployment 
check indicated the sensor went bad.

No salinity data collected from 05/01/97 00:00:00 - 05/08/97 14:00:00, program 
error (freshwater site, salinity range 00.0 to 00.2 ppt).

No data collected 05/08/97 14:30:00 due to instruments being swapped (retrieval 
with new deployment).

June

TS: All dissolved oxygen and percent saturation values from 06/01/97 00:00:0 
through 06/05/97 10:30:00 were too high (all over 100%) due to a faulty probe.  All values were 
deleted.

All dissolved oxygen and percent saturation values from 06/26/97 10:00:00 
through 06/30/97 23:30:00 were questionable due to a faulty probe.  All values were 
deleted.

No salinity data were collected from 06/01/97 00:00:00 through 06/05/97 10:30:00 
due to programming error (site is tidal freshwater so salinity ranges from 0.00 to 0.2 
ppt).

No temp., salin., cond., DO, or %DO from 06/05/97 11:00:00 through 06/26/97 
09:30:00 was collected because probe was not deployed for this sampling period.  Probe was 
sent to YSI for servicing or replacement.  Probe was replaced and data collection resumed on 
06/26/97 at 10:00:00.  

SK: No data collected 06/05/97 12:30:00, instruments were being swapped.

No salinity, conductivity, temp., or oxygen data collected from 06/05/97 
13:00:00 - 06/26/97 14:00:00.  Probe was not deployed for this sampling period, it was removed and 
sent to YSI for servicing or replacement.

No data were collected 06/26/97 14:30:00 - 15:30:00, instruments were being 
swapped.

No salinity data collected from 06/26/97 16:00:00 - 06/30/97 23:30:00, program 
error (freshwater site, salinity range 00.0 to 00.2 ppt).

July:

TS: All dissolved oxygen and percent saturation values from 07/01/97 00:00:00 
through 07/16/97 17:00:00 were questionable due to a faulty probe.  All values were 
deleted.

SK: No salinity data collected from 07/01/97 00:00:00 - 07/16/97 18:00:00 and 
again from 07/25/97 14:00:00 - 07/31/97 23:30:00, program error (freshwater site, salinity 
range 00.0 to 00.2 ppt).

No data collected from 07/16/97 18:30:00 - 07/19/97 16:30:00 (waiting for 
salin., cond., temp., oxygen probe).

No salin., cond., temp., oxygen data from 07/19/97 17:00:00 - 07/25/97 13:30:00 
(new or serviced probe not arrived, deployed instrument without this probe).

August:

TS: During a deployment starting on 08/06/97 at 09:00:00, the dissolved oxygen 
and percent saturation values began to drift to high values.  Post deployment check of the 
instrument indicated the DO sensor on this probe had gone bad during deployment.  Since we 
could not determine which values were good and which were affected, all values from 
08/06/97 09:00:00 through the end of the month were deleted.

SK:  No salinity data collected from 08/01/97 00:00:00 - 08/23/97 13:00:00, 
program error (freshwater site, salinity range 00.0 to 00.2 ppt).
No DO or DO% data 08/23/97 13:30:00 through 08/31/97 23:30:00.  Most values too 
high (over 150%) and very erratic.  Likely membrane was punctured.  These data were 
removed.

September:

TS:  During the deployment period starting on 08/06/97 at 09:00:00 through 
09/05/97 at 08:00:00, the dissolved oxygen and percent saturation values began to drift to 
high values.  
Post deployment check of the instrument indicated the DO sensor on this probe had 
gone bad during deployment. Since we could not determine which values were good and which were 
affected, all values from 09/01/97 00:00:00 through 09/05/97 @ 08:00:00 were deleted.

No data were collected from 09/05/97 @ 08:30:00 through 09/17/97 @ 08:00:00.  
Instrument not deployed.

No salinity data were collected from 09/17/97 08:30:00 through end of month due 
to programming error (site is tidal freshwater so salinity ranges from 00.0 to 00.2 
ppt).

SK:

No DO or DO% data 09/01/97 00:00:00 through 09/19/97 12: 00:00.  Most values too 
high (over 150%) and very erratic.  Likely membrane was punctured.  These data were 
removed.

No data collected 09/19/97 12:30 - 13:30.  Instrument not deployed.

October

TS:  One turbidity value recorded on 10/06/97 @ 13:00:00 (-0086 NTU) was a 
single anomalous data point and was deleted.  Cause was likely probe blockage.

No salinity data were collected from 10/01/97 00:00:00 through 10/08/97 09:30:00 
due to programming error (site is tidal freshwater so salinity ranges from 00.0 to 00.2 
ppt).

No data were collected on 10/08/97 10:00:00, instruments were being swapped.

No data were collected on 10/28/97 14:00:00 and 14:30:00, instruments were being 
swapped (one retrieved and a new instrument deployed) at this site.

All values deleted because probes were exposed at low tide due to the zero salinity and 
low depth from 10/28/97 18:30:00 through 19:00:00.

SK: No data collected 10/07/97 17:00:00 - 10/09/97 15:30:00 and 10/27/97 
17:00:00 - 10/28/97 11:30:00.  Instrument was being cleaned and calibrated.

No salinity data  10/28/97 12:00:00 through 10/31/97 23:30:00 due to
programming error (site is tidal freshwater so salinity ranges from 00.0 to 00.2 
ppt).

All dissolved oxygen and percent saturation data from 10/28/97 12:00:00 through 
10/31/97 23:30:00 were removed because of the negative values collected during this 
deployment period.

November:

TS: No data were collected from 11/12/97 05:00:00 through 08:00:00.  The 
instrument failed to turn on and collect data.  This was likely caused by the cold water (6.9 degrees 
C at 04:30:00) which dropped the battery voltage to 6.1 at 04:30:00.  The instrument resumed 
data collection at 08:30:00 (battery voltage @ 6.0, water temperature @ 8.6 degrees C).  

No data were collected from 11/12/97 15:30:00 through 11/26/97 09:30:00.  
Instrument data storage module filled during deployment, and all data for this collection period 
were lost automatically.

All values deleted because probes were exposed at low tide due to the zero salinity and 
low depth from 11/27/97 16:00:00 through 20:30:00.

SK: During the deployment of an instrument (10/28/97 12:00:00 - 11/12/97 
13:00:00) the dissolved oxygen sensor recorded many negative values for percent saturation and 
concentration of oxygen.  Because of this all dissolve oxygen and percent saturation from 
11/01/97 00:00:00 through 11/12/97 13:00:00 have been removed from the dataset.

No salinity data were collected from 11/01/97 00:00:00 through 11/12/97 13:00:00 
due to programming error (site is tidal freshwater so salinity ranges from 0.0 to 0.2 
ppt).

No data 11/25/97 14:00:00 - 14:30:00.  Instruments swapped in the field.

No data 11/26/97 @ 11:00:00.  Instrument was checked in the field for memory 
space.

December:

TS: The following data are missing because the probes were exposed at low tide:
12/02/97 09:30:00; 12/02/97 21:30:00 - 22:30:00; 12/03/07 09:00:00 - 11:00:00; 
12/14/97 20:30:00 - 21:30:00

A negative turbidity spike occurred on 12/14/97 @ 22:00:00 and was removed since 
it was  likely caused by the turbidity probe being exposed for the previous hour.

The instrument was retrieved for the year on 12/19/97 @ 11:30:00 due to ice, 
snow, and cold water temperatures.  No data were collected from 12/19/97 11:30:00 through end 
of month.

All values deleted because probes were exposed at low tide due to the zero salinity and 
low depth from 12/15/97 07:30:00 through 09:30:00.

SK: No data 12/09/97 13:30:00 to 12/14/97 16:30:00.  No data, instrument not 
deployed due to weather.

 Negative depth occurred on 12/29/97 10:00:00 because instrument was retrieved 
prior to this sample being taken.  All data for this date/time were removed.

Shortly after the 12/14/97 17:00:00 deployment, all DO and DO% values dropped 
rapidly to below 5.0%.  Post deployment calibration check indicated very low DO% (39.3%).  
All DO and DO% data from 12/14/97 17:00:00 to end of deployment (12/29/97 09:30:00) were 
removed. Cause is unknown but likely caused by faulty DO sensor.

No salinity data were collected from 12/14/97 17:00:00 through 12/29/97 09:30:00 
due to programming error (site is tidal freshwater so salinity ranges from 0.00 to 0.2 
ppt).

No data was collected 12/29/97 10:00 thru 12/31/97 23:30; instruments retrieved 
for the  year.
