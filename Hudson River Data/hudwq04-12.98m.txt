2.   Entry Verification:

     Data are analyzed for outliers and anomalies using the outlier macro for 
Excel 5.0 developed by the CDMO.  These macros discover outlier values which 
fall outside the range that the instrument is designed to measure (see section 
II.8 of this document). After outliers and anomalous data are identified using 
the CDMO Find Variable Outliers macro, all data are graphed in Excel to help 
identify outliers that fall within the range of the probes and also anomalous 
trends. Missing data are identified using the CDMO Excel Date, Hour Count macro.  
All columns are formatted using the CDMO Excel Column Reformat macro.  All data 
was FTPed to the CDMO via the CDMO dial-up access.  
All raw data files are archived at the CDMO and on 3.5" disks. Questionable data 
are either deleted or identified in section II.10.  All missing data and deleted 
data will be identified in section II.11.

3.   Research Objectives:

     Measurements are taken every 30 minutes over a two to four week period from 
April 1 through the end of November of each year at two locations within the 
Tivoli Bays component of the Hudson River NERR.  One datalogger monitors 
tributary water (Saw Kill, SK) entering the bay and the other monitors the 
Hudson River water flooding and ebbing to and from the bay (TS).  The objective 
of this study is to monitor the quality of the surface water entering (via 
stream flow and tidal exchange) and leaving (via tidal exchange) Tivoli South 
Bay.  This will help us understand the relative importance on each source of 
water on Tivoli South Bay.  The Reserve staff have identified urban and 
residential land use practices as having a major influence on the water 
chemistry of the Saw Kill.  Since residential coverage continues to increase, we 
hope that the intensive monitoring of the surface waters in this watershed will 
identify trends caused by this rapid development.  

4.   Research Methods:  

     Two YSI6000 dataloggers have been placed at the Tivoli Bays component site 
of the Reserve.  The instruments are deployed 0.5 meters off the bottom in 
vertically mounted perforated PVC tubes.  Instruments are deployed for a two to 
four week duration from April through November each year.  Data are collected at 
30 min. intervals. After instruments are retrieved, instrument calibration is 
checked against standards, data are uploaded, and instrument probes are 
serviced. Before each YSI 6000 is deployed, calibration and maintenance is 
performed following the manufacturer's instructions (YSI Manual addendum 7/94, 
sections 3,4, and 7). Data are uploaded via a cable to a laptop computer. 
Calibration standards are required for pH, turbidity, and salinity; all other 
parameters are done as described in the manual. Buffer solutions for 2 point 
calibration (pH 7 and 10), salinity and turbidity standards are purchased 
premade from a scientific supply house. The dissolved oxygen membranes are 
replaced before deployment and are allowed to sit at least 24 hrs prior to 
deployment. 

5.   Site Location and Character:

     The Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve (HUDNERR) is a 
multicomponent site composed of approximately 5,000 acres of tidal wetland, open 
water, and adjacent upland buffer habitat.  The four component sites of the 
Reserve are located on the Hudson River in New York State by river miles (RM) 
proceeding north from the southern tip of Manhattan.  These include: Stockport 
Flats (RM 124)(42o02'30"N 73o46'00"W), Columbia County; Tivoli Bays (RM 
98)(42o02'15"N 73o55'10"W), Dutchess County; and Iona Island (RM 45)(41o18'15"N 
73o58'45"W) and Piermont Marsh (RM 24)(41o02'30"N 73o54'15"W), Rockland County.  
These four components are located along 100 river miles of the Hudson and are 
representative of the diverse plant and animal communities that occupy the 
salinity gradient within the Hudson estuary.  Development within the watersheds 
of Hudson River NERR component sites ranges from predominantly urban/suburban to 
forested/agricultural.
     The two YSI6000 dataloggers are placed at Tivoli Bays component site. The 
Saw Kill (SK) 42? 01’ 01.543”N, 73? 54’ 53.589”W drains a 26.6 square mile 
(6886.5 hectares) watershed that is characterized as a highly mixed land use 
watershed.  These are both freshwater sites (0.0 ppt salinity).  Water depth at 
ranges from 0.0 to 2.0m at TS and 1.0 to 2.0 at SK.  Bottom type at TS is rocky 
and at SK is soft silt/clay.  The dominant land uses within this watershed 
include: forested (51.1%), agriculture (25.8%), and urban (16.5%).  Tivoli South 
Bay (TS) 42? 01’ 37.336”W, 73? 55’ 33.445”W, the receiving body for the Saw 
Kill, is a tidal freshwater wetland with a tidal range of 3.9 ft. (1.19 m).

6.   Data collection period:

     YSI6000 datalogger sampling at the Saw Kill (SK) and Tivoli South Bay (TS) 
began during May, 1995.  Sampling at Tivoli North Bay (TN) began during July, 
1996.  All sampling is ongoing, however, we cannot sample from approximately 
December 1 through March 31 due to winter storms and ice on the Hudson River and 
tributaries.  During a tropical storm during mid-July the SK deployment site was 
damaged and we were unable to repair it during 1996.  This site should be 
operational by April 1997.

7.   Associated researchers and projects:

     Hudson River NERR Water Quality Monitoring: Physical and chemical 
constituents of the tributary waters discharging into HUDNERR marshes and marsh 
waters during ebb tides are measured monthly and during storm events.  
Concentrations of nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, dissolved oxygen (DO), and 
chloride are measured, as well as, seston, alkalinity, pH, temperature, 
salinity, and conductivity. 
     Saw Kill Water Quality Monitoring:  The surface water draining from five 
subcatchments representing five dominant land use practices within the Saw Kill 
have been monitored during several storm events.  These five land use practices 
include: row crop agriculture, orchard, residential, solid waste landfill, and 
forested.  All of the above constituents have been monitored during this 
project.
     Associated researchers with the work at Tivoli Bays include: scientists 
from the Institute of Ecosystem Studies, Millbrook, NY; Yale School of Forestry 
and Environmental Studies, New Haven, CT; and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 
Troy, NY.

10.  Data anomalies

April

     SK:  None to report

  TS: Turbidity spike occurred on 4/1/98@20:30 (1358NTU), this value was deleted 
since it was erratic.

May

     SK:  Turbidity measurements on 05/02/98 at 20:00:00 (-0136NTU) and at 
20:30:00 (-0053NTU) were erratic and likely caused by probe blockage.  These values 
were deleted.

  TS: Negative turbidity spike occurred on 5/31/98@14:30 (-0011NTU).  Data point 
erratic and was deleted. 

June

     SK:  Turbidity measurements from 06/20/98 @ 08:30:00 through 06/22/98 @ 
10:00:00 were erratic.  Post calibration check of the probe on 0.0NTU measured 24.6NTU.  
After cleaning, the probe measured 0.0NTU.  During the deployment period, the 
probe became fouled.  These readings were left in but are suspect.

    TS:   DO (mg/L and %sat) from 6/22/98@15:30 to end of month were negative 
due to faulty probe.  Turbidity data from 6/25/98@19:30 to end of month were high 
because wiper fell off after deployment.

July

     SK:  None to report

     TS: DO (mg/L and %sat) from 7/1/98@00:00 to 7/4/98@20:30 and 7/7/98@00:00 -
7/22/98@10:30 were negative and were deleted.  This was caused first by a faulty 
probe and then by a punctured membrane on a replacement probe.  Turbidity from 7/1/98@00:00 to
7/4/98@20:30 were high because wiper fell off during deployment, all data was 
deleted. 
Turbidity spike occurred on 7/30/98@10:00 (1063NTU) measurement is erratic and 
was likely caused by probe blockage, this number was deleted.

August:

     SK:  Turbidity readings on 08/28/98 @ 21:00:00 and 21:30:00 were 0201NTU 
and 0332 NTU respectively.  Cause unknown, possibly probe blockage.  Values suspect but 
left in.

    TS: Post calibration check on DO was low (89.8%) for deployment that covered
  8/27/98@12:00 to end of month.  Therefore, recorded DO levels could be lower 
than what actually occurred.
          
September:

     SK:  Turbidity values of -0.1NTU recorded on 09/02/98 17:00; 09/09/98 
14:30; 09/10/98 15:00 & 16:00; 09/11/98 12:00, 12:30, 14:30, 15:00, & 15:30. These values 
were likely reading 0.0NTU and are well within the range of variability of the 
instrument.  All numbers changed to 0.0NTU.

    TS: Slightly negative depths were recorded on 9/7/98@9:00 (-0.01m) and 
9/7/98@21:00 (- 0.02m).  Probes were not exposed so these values are likely due to pressure 
changes and the values deviate from 0.0m.  Values replaced with 0.0m since they are within the 
acceptable range of the instrument.  Many negative turbidity values were recorded from 
9/1/98 00:00 to 9/10/98 11:00 due to gear box failure.  All negative numbers were deleted.  
These included:

Date     Time        Turb
mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss   NTU

09/04/98 11:30:00   -1126
09/07/98 01:00:00   -1016
09/07/98 02:00:00   -0113
09/07/98 20:30:00   -0140
09/07/98 21:00:00   -0124
09/08/98 02:30:00   -0360
09/08/98 03:00:00   -1122

    Post calibration check on turbidity for deployment from 9/1/98 00:00 to 
9/10/98 11:00 was slightly negative (-0000.1NTU).  Several slightly negative (-0000.1 to -
0000.6 NTU) occured during deployment and are being treated as 0000NTU since this range is 
acceptable variation for the instrument.  Note that the CDMO column reformat macro replaced and 
negative decimal value with 0000NTU.

October:

     SK:  Several negative turbidity values were logged from 10/08/98 - 
10/10/98. These occurred during a real turbidity event, however, I do not know why the instrument 
logged negative values.  Values are suspect but left in.  These included the following:

Date      Time      Turbidity
mm/dd/yy  hh:mm:ss  NTU
10/08/98  12:00:00  -0031
10/08/98  12:30:00  -0074
10/08/98  13:00:00  -0190
10/08/98  13:30:00  -0033
10/08/98  14:00:00  -0179
10/08/98  14:30:00  -0091
10/10/98  09:30:00  -0017
10/10/98  12:30:00  -0082
10/10/98  13:00:00  -0015
10/10/98  15:00:00  -0051
10/10/98  15:30:00  -0086

    TS: Slightly negative depth values changed to 0.0m since probes were not 
exposed on 10/31/98 4:00 (-0.04m), 4:30 (-0.04m), 5:00 (-0.02m).  Likely caused by 
changes in atmospheric pressure.

All values appear to be out of the water from 10/02/98 04:30:00 to 05:00:00 due to low tide
where depth was low and salinity was zero.  Values removed.  
 
November

     SK:  Post deployment calibration checks of percent saturation of DO during 
two deployments (affecting data collected from 11/05 - 11/30) was high (104.6 and 106.0%).  
Drift is likely the cause.  All DO% data collected during this period could therefore be 4-
6% higher than actually existed.  Data were left in but are suspect. 

    TS:  Slightly negative depth values changed to 0.0m since probes were not 
exposed on 11/28/98 01:30 (-0.03m), 02:00 (-0.07m); 11/29/98 14:00 (-0.03m), 14:30 (-
0.06m), 15:00 (- 0.03m).  Likely caused by changes in atmospheric pressure. Negative depth on
  11/28/98@2:30 (-0.07m) did result in exposing the probes so all data for this 
time was deleted.

  Post calibration check on 11/25/98 @ 15:00 - end of month deployment for DO% was 
117%. All DO data from 11/25/98 15:00:00 through 11/30/98 23:30:00 were deleted.  


December:

     SK:  None to report
    TS: Probes exposed on following dates so all data were removed: 
12/2/98@6:00-6:30, 12/3/98@7:30, 12/22/98@22:30-12/23/98@00:00.

Several negative turbidity values were recorded and the cause could be due to 
exposure of the probes on several occasions. These have all been deleted and included 
the following:

    The following negative depth values were recorded during this month.  These 
were fairly large but did not result in probe exposure so they were left in.  I did not 
convert them to 0.0m due to the size and the artificial truncation of the tidal curve that would 
result if I replaced them with 0.0m.  They are a result of changes in atmospheric pressure.

11.  Missing Data 

     TN:  April - December.  Note that no instruments were deployed at this site 
during 1998. 
     Review of the 1996 data indicated that the deployment site was exposed 
during daily low tides.  A new site has been identified and we hope to deploy instruments at 
TN in 1999.

April:

     SK:  No data 04/20/98 15:00:00 - 15:30:00.  Instrument retrieved and newly 
calibrated one deployed.

     TS: No data 4/1/98 00:00 - 4/1/98 10:30.  Instrument not deployed yet.  No 
data 4/13/98 8:30 - 10:00 and 4/30/98 11:00 - 15:30 for instrument swap.  Turbidity data for 4/1/98 @ 20:30 
was abnormally high and was deleted.

May

     SK:  Turbidity measurements on 05/02/98 at 20:00:00 (-0136NTU) and at 
20:30:00 (-0053NTU) were erratic and likely caused by probe blockage.  These values 
were deleted.

          No data were collected 05/05/98 @ 11:00:00 and 11:30:00; 05/18/98 
14:30:00. Instrument retrieved and newly calibrated one deployed.
  
     TS:   No data collected 5/17/98 13:30 - 15:30 for instrument swap. Negative 
turbidity spike occurred on 5/31/98@14:30 (-0011NTU), data point erratic and was deleted.

June

     SK:  No data were collected 06/22/98 @ 10:30:00. Instrument retrieved and

not deployed.  No data 7/22/98@11:00 to 7/28/98@13:00 due to probe problems, 
instrument not deployed.  DO (mg/L and %sat) from 7/1/98@00:00 to 7/4/98@20:30 and 7/7/98@00:00 
-7/22/98@10:30 were negative and were deleted.  This was caused first by a faulty 
probe and then by a punctured membrane on a replacement probe.  Turbidity from 7/1/98@00:00 to
7/4/98@20:30 were high because wiper fell off during deployment, all data was 
deleted.
Turbidity spike occurred on 7/30/98@10:00 (1063NTU) measurement is erratic and 
was likely caused by probe blockage, this number was deleted.

August:

     SK:  No data 08/11/98 @ 15:00:00-16:00:00. Instrument retrieved and newly 
calibrated one deployed.

  TS: No data 8/12/98@ 11:30-12:00 and 8/27/98@11:30 for instrument swap.

September:

     SK:  No data 09/11/98 16:30 - 17:00.  Instrument retrieved and newly 
calibrated one deployed.

  TS:   No data 9/10/98@11:30 due to instrument swap. 

    Many large negative turbidity values were recorded from 9/1/98 00:00 to 
9/10/98 11:00 due to gear box failure.  All large negative numbers were deleted.  These 
included:

Date     Time        Turb
mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss   NTU

09/04/98 11:30:00   -1126

October:

     SK:  No data 10/01/98 14:30 - 18:30 due to instrument swap.
    TS: No data 10/1/98@16:00 and 10/29/98@14:00-14:30 due to instrument swap.

All values appear to be out of the water from 10/02/98 04:30:00 to 05:00:00 due to low tide
where depth was low and salinity was zero.  Values removed.

November:

     SK:  None to report
    TS: No data 11/28/98@02:30, probes exposed

 Post calibration check on 11/25/98 @ 15:00 - end of month deployment for DO% was 
117%. All DO data from 11/25/98 15:00:00 through 11/30/98 23:30:00 were deleted.  

December:

     SK:  No data collected 12/23/98 12:00:00 though 12/31/98 23:30:00.  
Instruments pulled for year due to ice and freezing temperatures.

    TS:  All DO data from 12/01/98 00:00:00 through 12/10/98 11:30:00 were deleted due to
suspect deployment where DO values were >100%.  

No data 12/10/98@11:00-11:30 due to instrument swap.  No data 12/23/98@11:30 
to end of month, instruments pulled for the year due to ice and winter weather.

    Probes exposed on following dates so all data were removed: 12/2/98@6:00-
6:30, 12/3/98@7:30, 12/22/98@22:30-12/23/98@00:00.

    Several negative turbidity values were recorded and the cause could be due 
to exposure of the probes on several occasions. These have all been deleted and included the 
following:
