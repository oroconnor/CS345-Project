2.   Entry Verification:

	The CDMO cdmomac3.xls macro will allow the user to automatically format 
column widths to the correct number of decimal places based on YSI sensor 
specifications.  It also allows the user to QA/QC each data logger generated 
file for missing data points, fill all cells that do not contain data with 
periods, and find all data points that fall outside the range of what the data 
logger is designed to measure (outliers).  The CDMO import.xls macro will allow 
PC users with 30-minute data to automatically create a monthly Excel file from a 
two-week deployment and insert periods for missing data.  In addition, in 
November 1999 a graphing capability was added to this macro allowing users to 
produce single parameter and missing data point graphs on a monthly basis.  
Questionable data are either deleted or identified in section II.10.	Persons 
responsible for data verification are theResearch Coordinator and Research 
Assistant, Erik Bedan.

3.   Research Objectives:

	Measurements are taken every 30 minutes over a two to four week period 
from April 1 through the end of December of each year at three locations within 
the Tivoli Bays component of the Hudson River NERR.  One datalogger monitors 
tributary water (Saw Kill Creek) entering one bay and two dataloggers monitor 
the Hudson River water flooding and ebbing to and from both bays (Tivoli South 
Bay and Tivoli North Bay).  The objective of this study is to monitor the 
quality of the surface water entering (via stream flow and tidal exchange) and 
leaving (via tidal exchange) Tivoli South Bay and Tivoli North Bay.  This will 
help us understand the relative importance on each source of water in Tivoli 
Bays.  The Reserve staff has identified urban and residential land use practices 
as having a major influence on the water chemistry of the Saw Kill Creek.  Since 
residential coverage continues to increase, we hope that the intensive 
monitoring of the surface waters in this watershed will identify trends caused 
by this rapid development.

4.   Research Methods:  

	Three YSI 6-series dataloggers have been placed at the Tivoli Bays 
component site of the Reserve.  The Saw Kill Creek and Tivoli South instruments 
are deployed at 0.5 and 0.5 meters respectively off the bottom in vertically 
mounted perforated PVC tubes.  The Tivoli North instrument is deployed in a 
rectangular 24"x13"x13" cage with 1/2 inch plastic coated mesh and weighed down 
with 4 bricks zip tied to the cage.  The sonde is placed horizontally in the 
cage, strapped in with bungee cords and rests .25 meters from the bottom of the 
cage.  The cage is tied to a woodpile and rests on the bottom, also a cable is 
attached to the top of the cage and the other end is anchored to the sediment.  
Instruments are deployed for two to four week duration from April through 
December of each year.  Data are collected at 30 min. intervals. After 
instruments are retrieved, instrument calibration is checked against standards, 
data are uploaded, and instrument probes are serviced.  Before each YSI 6-series 
datalogger is deployed, calibration and maintenance is performed following the 
manufacturer's instructions (YSI Manual, sections 3,4, and 7 as well as the YSI 
6-series operations manual). Data are uploaded via a cable to a desktop 
computer. Calibration standards are required for pH, turbidity, and 
conductivity; all other parameters are calibrated as described in the manual.  
pH buffer solutions for 2 point calibration (pH 7 and 10), conductivity and 
turbidity standards are purchased pre-made from a scientific supply company. The 
dissolved oxygen membranes are replaced before deployment, and are allowed to 
equilibrate for at least 24 hrs prior to deployment. 

5.   Site Location and Character:

	The Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve (HUDNERR) is a 
multicomponent site composed of approximately 5,000 acres of tidal wetland, open 
water, and adjacent upland buffer habitat.  The four component sites of the 
Reserve are located on the Hudson River in New York State by river miles (RM) 
proceeding north from the southern tip of Manhattan.  These include: Stockport 
Flats (RM 124)(42º 02'30"N 73º 46'00"W), Columbia County; Tivoli Bays (RM 
98)(42º 02'15"N 73(55'10"W), Dutchess County; and Iona Island (RM 45)(41º 
18'15"N 73(58'45"W) and Piermont Marsh (RM 24)(41º 02'30"N 73º 54'15"W), 
Rockland County.  These four components are located along 100 miles of the 
Hudson River and are representative of the diverse plant and animal communities 
that occupy the salinity gradient within the Hudson estuary.  Development within 
the watersheds of Hudson River NERR component sites ranges from predominantly 
urban/suburban to forested/agricultural.  The three YSI 6-series dataloggers are 
placed at the Tivoli Bays component site.  The Saw Kill (SK) (latitude 42? 01' 
01.543" N, longitude 73º 54' 53.589" W) drains a 26.6 square mile (6886.5 
hectares) is the main tributary flowing into Tivoli South Bay.  Some 
characteristics of the Saw kill include a rocky bottom type, and a watershed 
that is characterized as a highly mixed land use watershed.  Tivoli South Bay 
(TS) (latitude 42? 01' 37.336" N, longitude 73? 55' 33.445" W) is the receiving 
body for the Saw Kill.  This bay is a tidal freshwater wetland with a tidal 
range of 3.9 ft. (1.19 m).  The bottom type at Tivoli South Bay is soft, 
silt/clay.  The dominant land uses within this watershed include: forested 
(51.1%), agriculture (25.8%), and urban (16.5%) areas.  Tivoli North Bay (TN) 
(latitude 42? 02' 11.56464" N, longitude 73? 55' 31.16645" W) is a freshwater 
tidal marsh dominated by Typha angustifolia.  The primary watershed to TN is 23 
square miles in size and is dominated by agricultural lands.  Tivoli North Bay 
has a tidal range of 3.9 ft (1.19 m) as well.  The Stony Creek is the principle 
tributary flowing into Tivoli North Bay. SK, TS, and TN are all freshwater sites 
(0.0 ppt salinity) with water depth ranges from 0.0 to 2.0m at TS and TN, while 
water depth is 1.0 to 2.0m at SK.

6.   Data collection period:
	YSI 6-series datalogger sampling at the Saw Kill (SK) and Tivoli South Bay 
(TS) began during May, 1995.  Sampling at Tivoli North Bay (TN) began during 
July,1996, however ceased in 1997-1998 because at low tide the instrument was 
exposed.  In 1999 an alternate site was established for Tivoli North and 
sampling began in July of 1999 .  All sampling is ongoing, however, we cannot 
sample from approximately mid December through March 31 due to winter storms and 
ice on the Hudson River and the tributaries.  The YSI6600 datalogger was 
deployed at the Tivoli South Bay site replacing the YSI6000 starting on July 1, 
1999 @ 15:30:00.

12.  Missing Data 

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set. Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre and post) problems. For more details on deleted data, see 
the Anomalous Data (Section 10). To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14. Other Remarks

On 06/30/2021 this dataset was updated to include embedded QAQC flags for 
anomalous/suspect data.  System-wide monitoring data beginning in 2007 were 
processed to allow for QAQC flags and codes to be embedded in the data files 
rather than detailed in the metadata alone (as in the anomalous/suspect, 
deleted, and missing data sections above).  Prior to 2006, rejected data were 
deleted from the dataset so they are unavailable to be used at all, but suspect 
data were only noted in the metadata document.  Suspect data flags <1> were 
embedded retroactively in order to allow suspect data to be easily identified 
and filtered from the dataset if desired for analysis and reporting purposes.  
No other flags or codes were embedded in the dataset and users should still 
refer to the detailed explanations above for more information.

Any reference made to depth data being negative and/or zero, it was 
recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in the edited data file 
due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited none of these data points 
by hand nor did the technician delete any of them. 

HUDSKWQ:

There was significant rainfall on between June 1 and June 3. This event caused a 
noticeable drop in the specific conductivity for several days. The data were left 
in.
